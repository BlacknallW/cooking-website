    <h2 class="bloghead">A Pretty Typical Origin Story</h2>
    <p>As a young lad who grew up quite impoverished, my mother did the best she could with nourishing her three children until our picky eating caused her to throw her hands up and say, "I'm not cooking anymore! You want to eat? YOU COOK!". For a while, our "self-made" meals consisted of ramen, scrambled eggs, and PB&J sandwiches. It wasn't until I was around 13 that I finally took her up on her challenge and decided to make a full meal from scratch. The meal? Chicken tenders, french fries, and mac 'n' cheese. Of course, when I say "from scratch" I of course mean "from box/bag". This is when I discovered spices. Everything I made was spiced to hell and back, with no particular rhyme or reason as to why I used the spices I used. "Should I add crushed red peppers to this?" was a rhetorical question regardless of the dish. The answer, of course, was "Yes, and also add seasoning salt and garlic powder for good measure". Now, as a recovering spice-addict, I still like some heat in my dishes, but I also have to be mindful of the guests (I never have guests) that try my cooking. Now, this might come as an insult to my mother, but I never knew home-cooked food could actually taste good. I assumed that each time we went to a restaurant, the quality of the food came from the fact that it was prepared in a restaurant. Being that your house isn't a restaurant (unless you live above a restaurant), there was no way to cook restaurant-quality food. I wasn’t able to finally put that theory to the test until about 10 years later, once I had just enough money to start buying cookware and still pay my rent. As of writing this, I’ve recently turned 24, so my experience with “real deal” cooking is pretty much just one year. </p>
    <h2 class="bloghead">What I've Learned</h2>
    <p>I don't know. Yes, to be completely honest, I don't know what I've learned. My first foray into making dishes I'd never made or even eaten before was through a meal delivery service, starting with Hello Fresh, then moving on to Home Chef because the meals looked meatier. Honestly, if you're someone who feels like cooking is "too hard", I would strongly recommend starting your adventures into the realm with a pre-portioned meal service. The hardest thing about cooking, in my opinion, is amping yourself up to do meal prep. Even then, meal prep isn't necessarily "hard", it's jut time consuming, which probably makes sense because preparing for anything in general is going to take a lot of time. I feel like I'm especially equipped to speak on this because I am by no means an expert. My knife technique is garbage, my "eyeballing" method typically results in meals that should only be eaten while attached to a blood pressure monitor, and for the life of me I can't pinpoint the best temperature to cook things on the stove. The important thing is to keep at it! Repetition, repetition, repetition!</p>
    <h2 class="bloghead">What Should I Make First?</h2>
    <p>Make what you want to eat. For the real reals, think about your favorite <span><em>type</em></span> of food. For me, as you've probably guessed from the image above, I absolutely adore Asian Cousine. The dishes appeal to both my desire to catch my mouth on fire as well as die of high blood pressure. By looking up the recipes of my favorite dishes and actually cooking them, I was excited throughout the entire process. Each time I tasted a sauce or seasoning, I'd ask myself, "Does this taste like what I had at Kuroshio?". When my plate of homemade eggrolls, General Tso's Chicken, and steamed rice(less impressive) was complete, I was extremely giddy. And let me tell you, as someone who has the emotional highs of Droopy the Dog("Hello, all you happy people."), me being giddy is a big deal. It also gave me an opportunity to bond with my mother, as she came over to my apartment and we went and got all the ingredients together before doing some first-time tag-team cooking. Eating food that you love to eat, prepared by your own hands, with the people you love (or like just enough to invite them over), is a really fulfilling feeling of its own.</p>
    <h2 class="bloghead">Cooking Media, Community, and Celebrities</h2>
    <p>Oh hey, by the way, who did you vote for in the last election? What are your thoughts on the 2nd Ammendment? Feeling defensive yet? One of the best things about immersing yourself into the world of cooking is <span><em><bold>there are no politics!</bold></em></span> Well, at least not in the conventional sense. Do you prefer electric stoves over gas stoves? Good news! You're wrong. Don't @ me. Whenever I watch a video about cooking, it's just that, a video about cooking. There are no charged political messages or debating about the economy. <span><em>It's just cooking.</em></span> These are people with different views, beliefs, affiliations, and orientations just gathering around in a kitchen and trying to make what would be considered objectively the best <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKtIunYVkv_RSLdWzWGYx8kmJQBVhNP0w" target="_blank">pizza</a>. This is a guy with unknown origins making food that he saw from cartoons and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/bgfilms" target="_blank">movies</a>. This man goes around to different countries making friends and eating food, mentioning the history of the areas but keeping it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv29Sjt7LnA" target="_blank">informational</a>. The best thing about cooking is how much of a unifying force it is. Are you a chef? No? Oh, okay. Do you want to eat my food? We're friends now. Do you like my food? I love you, feel free to stay in my life forever. The only thing you need to be welcomed into the cooking community is a mouth and a tongue. Teeth optional.</p>
