            <p>Greetings and salutations! My name is William Blacknall and I am a pseudo-homechef, (future) developer, teacher, and lifelong student. I got my B.S.Ed in Middle Grades Education with a concentration in Math and Science from Georgia Southern University, and have four years of teaching experience. I left the field of teaching to pursue my passion for technology and software development, and while I do miss my students and colleagues dearly, I am excited about the opportunities of the future.</p>
            <p>As you might have guessed from this website, I enjoy all things dealing with cooking (aside from meal prep)! As someone whose childhood was spent trying to make everyone happy, I've learned that one of the universal tenents to happiness is a full stomach. I don't have the chops to do it as a profession, but it's still exciting to do as a hobby. </p>
