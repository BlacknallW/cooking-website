            <p>Hello, my name is William and I am not good at taking pictures. This picture that you see here, which I am currently using across multiple platforms, is actually my best attempt out of easily 50 pictures with different expressions, lighting, and location. Now that you know just how much of a photagrapher I am not, let me tell you a little bit about who I am.</p>
            <p>Weirdly enough, I don't really have a straight answer to that either. I used to be a teacher, but now I'm a (junior) developer. You know, the weird thing is I could go on and on about the content on the homepage, but I can honestly say the feeling of confusion I'm having while writing this "About Me" page is equivalent to going to a restaurant for the first time and having a notably impatient server. Anyway, read this next line like a Die Hard-esque action hero that just messed everything up by disobeying a direct order and going rogue on an important case.</p>
            <p class="diehard">"I let you down, chief. And I'll probably let you down again in the future. But don't you for a second think that it's because I don't care about you. You are more important to me than you'll ever know. You're forgiving, and that's exactly why I keep making mistakes, because I know you'll forgive me. But I've realized that what I actually want is to make you proud of something I've done right. Today is not that day, but tomorrow...tomorrow I'll be better."</p>
            <p>Wasn't that fun? I'm glad we shared that moment together. </p>
